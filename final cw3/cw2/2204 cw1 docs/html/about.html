            At Hong Kong Industrial University, we offer a student-centered
            educational approach that encourages cross-disciplinary research in an
            international environment. Our curriculum is based on international
            standards and is taught entirely in English. We encourage undergraduate
            students to join research groups from their first year, with approximately
            82% of our undergraduate students joining research groups by their third
            year and 100% by their final year. To broaden our students' international
            perspectives, we provide them various overseas study opportunities,
            including at world-renowned universities such as Harvard University,
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University, City
            University of Hong Kong, and Peking University.
            Our faculty members are recognized leaders in their fields, with 321
            tenured professors and 80% with overseas study or work experience. As a
            university committed to innovation, we have created an atmosphere on
            campus that supports and encourages entrepreneurship. We have established
            370 spin-off companies, with 114 of them founded in 2024 alone. Our
            incubator programs provide students and faculty opportunities to connect
            with technology, market, policy, and capital resources, making it a
            crucial "power source" for innovation practice.
            Hong Kong Industrial University's strength lies in our world-class
            facilities and talented faculty and students. We are dedicated to
            providing our students with the resources and guidance they need to excel
            in their fields and positively impact society. Thank you for considering
